    My friend gave me this unfinished game to test and told me he left a flag at the x. 
    What does that even mean? I dunno.

    Here's the game:
    {{link}}

flag:
    file: ./flag.txt

containers:
    main:
        build: .
        resources:
            limits:
                cpu: 100m
                memory: 100M
        ports:
            - 3000

expose:
    main:
        - target: 3000
